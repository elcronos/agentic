## Scene 1

A medium shot of a realistic kangaroo wearing black sunglasses, holding a vlog camera out in front of him. He is standing in front of the Eiffel Tower on a sunny day, looking up at it with a look of awe and a wide grin. He says excitedly: "Crikey, mates! It's even bigger and pointier than on the postcards!". The scene is filmed from a front-facing camera perspective with a realistic, 4k, high quality, vlog style.

## Scene 2

A close-up shot of the same kangaroo wearing black sunglasses, now standing in front of the Louvre Pyramid. He adjusts his sunglasses, and the camera captures his reflection in them. He winks at the camera and says cheekily: "Right, off to find that Mona Lisa painting. I've heard her smile is almost as charming as mine.". The scene is filmed with a slight handheld wobble, characteristic of a realistic, 4k, high quality, vlog style.

## Scene 3

A point-of-view shot from the kangaroo's perspective on a Bateaux-Mouches boat on the Seine River. We see his paws holding the camera as he pans across the Parisian architecture along the riverbank. He says romantically: "The city of love, they call it. The only thing missing is a lovely sheila-roo to share it with!". The scene is filmed to look like a tourist's vlog, with natural lighting, in realistic, 4k, high quality.

## Scene 4

A close-up shot of the kangaroo with sunglasses, sitting at a small Parisian café table in Montmartre with the Sacré-Cœur visible in the background. He takes a huge, satisfying bite of a buttery croissant. With his mouth full, he says enthusiastically: "Forget gum leaves, this is the best tucker on the planet!". The scene is filmed from a front-facing, vlogger perspective, with a shallow depth of field, in realistic, 4k, high quality.
